# Dynamic-Programming-for-Autonomous-Navigation
Designed and implemented a Dynamic Programming algorithm to solve a finite-horizon optimal control problem by deriving control actions for an agent to pick up a key, unlock the door and reach its goal position from the start position. Modified the algorithm to make it compatible with changing conditions like key and door locations.
